# Briefs — Policy

This file defines what `briefs/` is in this project, who writes there, and how briefs relate to `policies/`.

## What briefs are

`briefs/` is a **read-write working library** of internal documents — research,
methodology, audits, source-material snapshots, positions taken, and choices
weighed — produced and consulted as the project evolves. Briefs hold durable
thinking, not binding rules: a brief may recommend or record a choice, but the
specific choice future work must obey lives in `policies/`.

A brief captures *durable* analysis or reasoning that future work will refer back to. A brief is the answer to questions like:
- "What's the canonical way to do X, and where did we get that?"
- "Why did we decide Y? What did we evaluate?"
- "What was the state of the world when we last checked Z?"
- "Did we already research this?"

## What briefs are not

- **Code.** Anything executable lives in `bin/` or the eventual application tree.
- **A queue.** Work to be done lives in commit messages, a TODO list, or an issue tracker — not in `briefs/`.
- **A policy.** Operational rules — "always do X, never Y, here's the schema" — live in `policies/`. A brief *informs* policy; a brief is not policy.
- **A log.** Briefs capture durable positions, not running history.
- **Third-party documentation.** Vendor pages, specifications, RFCs, and license texts are pinned verbatim under `docs/reference/` ([`docs.md`](docs.md)). A brief cites the pin and holds what the project *concluded* from it; it never carries the source text itself.

## When to write one

Write a brief when:
- Research turns up a position or methodology the team will cite later (a BCP list, a measured number, a worked example).
- A non-trivial decision is made whose reasoning matters more than its outcome.
- An audit, evaluation, or discrepancy review produces findings that will inform future work.
- A snapshot of an external system's *observed state or behavior* (cloud infrastructure as configured, how a third-party service actually responded) is worth pinning at a specific date. The vendor's own published document is a different thing: that goes under `docs/reference/`, and the brief records what was observed and concluded against it.
- An outward explanation, white paper, or treatise needs a canonical internal
  source. Repair the owning brief before rendering derivative formats; see
  [`treatise.md`](treatise.md).

Don't write a brief for ephemeral state, single-session decisions, or anything that fits inside a commit message.

## Conventions

- **Filename:** kebab-case, descriptive (`s3-access-log-bcps.md`, not `notes-04.md`). No dates in filenames.
- **Frontmatter (YAML):** every brief opens with:
  - `title:` — short scannable title.
  - `date:` — ISO date authored or last revised.
  - `status:` — one of `draft` | `methodology` | `implemented` | `historical`.
  - `scope:` — one sentence describing the brief's purpose.
  - `treatise:` — **only on a treatise brief.** A mapping holding that
    treatise's editorial record: purpose, audience, register, coverage, the
    operator's dated directives, renderings, external facts, and open
    questions. Its presence marks the brief as governed by
    [`treatise.md`](treatise.md); `bin/treatise validate` enforces its shape.
    Ordinary briefs never carry it.
- **Body:** purpose paragraph, then numbered or named sections, then a Sources section if applicable.
- **Cross-references:** link briefs to other briefs and external sources when
  the dependency is load-bearing. Never link from a brief to `policies/` or
  `plan/`; state the constraint self-sufficiently and let the policy or plan
  cite the brief in the other direction.

## Status lifecycle

- `draft` — still being shaped; numbers and conclusions tentative.
- `methodology` — defines an approach the project defers to. In a methodology-following repo this marker also signals *portable Methodology Contract content* — do not apply it to a project-specific design or survey merely because it feels durable or foundational; a cross-repo `learn` pass that trusts the marker as a selector would mis-transfer domain content into the template. Durable domain briefs belong in `draft`/`implemented`/`historical`.
- `implemented` — the position has been realized in code or operational practice.
- `historical` — superseded by a later brief or by changed reality; kept for the audit trail.

When reality changes, prefer updating the brief to retiring it; mark superseded briefs `historical` rather than deleting them.

## Authority

Briefs are subordinate to active `policies/` for next-action questions. They are *authoritative* for cross-session reasoning, methodology, and snapshot-of-the-world claims.

When a brief and a more current source disagree, prefer the live source — but update or annotate the brief to reflect the new reality. Briefs decay if not maintained.
