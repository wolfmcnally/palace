# Policy: Per-Role Execution Budgets

Authority mode follows [four-canonical-agents.md](four-canonical-agents.md). Product primary mode uses independent advice and primary acceptance; delegated product mode retains approval verdicts and bounded revision loops. References below to reviewer assent or mandatory re-review govern delegated work only. Required objective gates and truthful evidence apply in both modes. All methodology work, including teach/learn, follows [review-lanes.md](review-lanes.md): one-shot by the primary, no delegated production or review, and commit/fast-forward-push authority after required checks.

Every `kickoff` role invocation has three independent guards: **first structured event**, **idle progress**, and **absolute runtime**. A role may legitimately take a long time; it may not disappear silently or run without an upper bound. Budgets apply to each invocation or resumed revision round, not to the phase as a whole.

## Shipped budgets

The human-editable `role_timeouts` section of [`kickoff.yaml`](../kickoff.yaml) is the source of truth. `bin/kickoff-config` validates and consumes it without disturbing `role_models`, comments, or data under `extensions`.

| Role | Hard deadline | Idle watchdog | Claude CLI turn cap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Planner | 1,800 s | 600 s | 50 |
| Plan reviewer | 1,800 s | 600 s | 50 |
| Coder | 7,200 s | 1,200 s | 200 |
| Code critic | 2,700 s | 600 s | 50 |

Every role must produce its first structured event within **120 seconds**. The turn column is deliberately named `claude_max_turns` in configuration: Claude exposes that CLI circuit breaker, while Codex and native subagents do not expose an equivalent per-invocation flag. Their enforceable guards are the three clocks. Authentication preflight has its own 120-second deadline in [`role-models.md`](role-models.md). The 10-cycle convergence backstop remains separate: it limits revision rounds, while this policy limits one round.

These are hang guards, not performance targets or promises. Planning and review get enough room for repository inspection and reasoning; implementation gets a materially larger envelope; critique sits between them. There is deliberately no whole-phase timeout because phase scope and build gates vary too widely.

## Enforcement

External CLI roles run through `bin/kickoff-config watch`. The wrapper:

1. starts the command in its own process group with stdin closed;
2. tees structured stdout and diagnostics to named artifacts;
3. requires a first stdout event even when the child exits quickly, resets the idle clock on subsequent stdout or stderr activity, and enforces the hard deadline regardless of activity;
4. truncates named result artifacts before launch and requires the current call to repopulate them;
5. verifies that the actual CLI/model/effort flags match the recorded routing metadata;
6. terminates the entire process group on timeout, preserving artifacts and any session identifier already emitted; and
7. records child status, artifact freshness, and terminal stream completeness
   independently; and
8. returns 124 on timeout, 65 on an unrecoverable protocol failure, 66 when a
   fresh artifact requires explicit verification after an incomplete terminal
   stream, or the child's status otherwise.

Codex runs with JSONL events, requires a terminal `turn.completed`, and names
its `--output-last-message` path as the watchdog's required output. Claude runs
with `--output-format stream-json --verbose`; the wrapper normally extracts
the final `result` event and can preserve the last assistant text for exit 66.
The role-shape and candidate-bound evidence gates in
[`role-models.md`](role-models.md) still apply after the process exits.

Native roles use the same role-specific hard and idle budgets through the orchestrating harness's sub-agent wait/status mechanism. If the harness cannot expose structured progress or an idle watchdog, enforce the hard deadline and report that idle telemetry was unavailable; do not invent activity. The orchestrator remains responsive and gives the user a progress update at least every 60 seconds while it waits.

One max-turn rescue is allowed only for a review role that completed investigation but failed to emit its verdict. Resume the existing session with the concise “conclude now” instruction. Do not automatically rerun a timed-out role from scratch: a timeout follows [governed recovery](role-models.md#governed-recovery), preserving the failed attempt and selected model/effort. No automatic native substitution is authorized.

### The harness ceiling bounds every budget

The effective budget is the smaller of the configured role budget and the
execution surface's hard ceiling. Some foreground calls silently clamp long
timeouts; others yield a durable session handle that remains observable. Prove
which behavior the active harness provides before dispatch. If a foreground
call would be clamped or its handle would be lost, use the harness's tracked
background mechanism. Detached `nohup` is not an acceptable substitute because
it forfeits the completion signal.

After any interrupted dispatch, verify that its dispatch row exists and close
orphaned spans unconditionally. Diagnose the caller's ceiling, parent timeout,
and process group before blaming the delegated venue. Exit 143, a stopped
stream, an empty result artifact, and a missing dispatch row together are the
silent-death signature; an empty artifact by itself is normal while a role is
still running.

## Authoritative and local telemetry

The finalized shared trace governed by
[`execution-telemetry.md`](execution-telemetry.md) is authoritative for phase
timing. It uses monotonic nanoseconds, exact role/wait joins, and truthful
timeout/interruption outcomes. Wait spans mirror delegated work and are never
counted as additional work. Time awaiting required user input is recorded in
the separate phase-level operator-park ledger and never folded into a role's
idle or wait duration.

The watcher also keeps local protocol diagnostics for timeout recalibration.
Those rows are not a second execution ledger and cannot fill a missing shared span. Their `model`/`effort` fields record requests; optional provider observations and null-as-unreported reporting follow [`role-models.md`](role-models.md#end-block-reporting). Observation failures neither establish success nor change routing.

## Local recalibration

Every watched invocation appends one JSON object to
`.kickoff/role-timings.jsonl`, which is local runtime state and must not be
committed. Records include separate model and effort fields alongside phase,
role, venue, timestamps, duration, first-event latency, longest idle gap,
best-effort turns/tokens, outcome, timeout kind, wrapper exit code, child exit
code, artifact status, and stream status. The END block summarizes timings and
verified protocol recoveries for the phase; raw records stay local.

The run-scoped evidence ledgers separately record packet bytes and source
hashes, candidate ids, changed-path counts, finding states/reopenings/
classifications, and gate results. Do not infer nested reasoning, repository
read, test, idle-cause, or critical-path spans when a venue does not emit them;
record unavailable data as `unknown`.

`bin/kickoff-config recommend-timeouts` groups successful records by `(role, venue, model, effort)`. It emits a recommendation only after at least 30 successful samples in a group:

```
hard deadline = max(role hard floor, 2 × p95 successful duration)
idle watchdog = max(role idle floor, 2 × p95 longest successful idle gap)
```

Timeouts are right-censored evidence, not successful durations. Review them separately before changing a budget. Recommendations never rewrite configuration and never auto-tighten a deadline; a human evaluates the workload and edits the policy/config together.

## Portability

The two policy sections, unified config schema and shipped defaults, manager, telemetry schema, `kickoff` instructions, `roles`, and invocation recipes are one **atomic universal bundle**. `teach` proposes it atomically but preserves an existing target's values, comments, `extensions` data, local telemetry, model choices, and project-specific overrides. `learn` may adopt improved mechanics, schema, algorithms, or universal defaults, but never imports donor operational state.

## Relationship to other policies

- [`role-models.md`](role-models.md) resolves venue/model/effort, performs fail-closed preflight, gates artifacts, and owns governed runtime recovery.
- [`execution-telemetry.md`](execution-telemetry.md) owns exact shared spans, aggregation, recovery, and the phase report.
- [`four-canonical-agents.md`](four-canonical-agents.md) owns role semantics and the ten-cycle convergence limit.
- [`mechanistic-vs-intelligence.md`](mechanistic-vs-intelligence.md) places validation, enforcement, measurement, and percentile calculation in `bin/kickoff-config`; deciding whether evidence warrants a policy change remains human judgment.
- [`human-in-the-loop.md`](human-in-the-loop.md) still governs completion: timing out or finishing within budget says nothing about subjective acceptance.
