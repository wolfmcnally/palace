# Sweep — Prune and graduate the rule surfaces

Codified knowledge rots: rules contradict each other, skills drift out of step with the repo they describe, briefs outlive their status, ledger candidates age without a decision, and catalogs fall out of sync with the files on disk. `sweep` is the maintenance half of the improvement flywheel described in [`briefs/harness-self-improvement.md`](../../../briefs/harness-self-improvement.md): the capture half (`kickoff`'s lessons harvest) only compounds if something also prunes. Without a recurring sweep, the compounding asset becomes a compounding liability.

`sweep` is **plan-first and user-gated**: it audits, classifies, and proposes; the user ratifies; only then does it apply. It never silently edits a rule surface.

## Parse arguments

Raw arguments: `!{ARGUMENTS}`

- If empty, run the full pass over every audit area below.
- If a focus is named (`skills`, `lessons`, `policies`, `briefs`, `catalogs`, `corpus`), run only that area plus the mechanical checks (which are cheap and always run).

## Stage 1 — Audit (read-only)

Run the mechanical checks first — they are deterministic and their output anchors the rest:

1. `./bin/check-catalogs` — catalog/file sync, current-candidate internal-link integrity
   (paths *and* `#fragment` anchors), the one-way brief → policy/plan citation
   direction, the `docs/reference/` contract (every pin cataloged in `docs/reference/README.md`,
   no pin linking outside `docs/reference/`), and the lifecycle-aware phase-ledger state machine.
2. `./bin/lessons validate` — ledger schema health.
3. `./bin/lessons candidates` — graduation-ready lessons (≥3 occurrences).
4. `./bin/test-governance reassess` when the proof-estate bundle exists —
   verify the frozen ceilings, dispositions, admissions, critical risks,
   effectiveness floors, and zero-net-growth. Rerun the assay when proof code,
   selection, corpus, or risk applicability changed, and surface every
   dominated-proof finding.

Then the judgment audits, each producing candidate findings:

5. **Policies.** Read `policies/` against `LOG.md`, `lessons/`, and the repo's current shape. Flag: rules that contradict each other or a newer policy; rules describing machinery that no longer exists; rules that have never prevented anything (no LOG/lesson/finding has referenced them since adoption — a candidate for merging or retirement, not automatic deletion); policy examples that have drifted from the files they cite. Apply the doctrine's growth rule ([`briefs/methodology.md`](../../../briefs/methodology.md) § Orchestration runtime doctrine) to every binding orchestration step: a step that cannot name the park it prevents or cite its motivating incident, or whose failure family a later structural fix made dead, is a deletion or demote-to-advisory candidate.
6. **Briefs.** Check each brief's `status` against reality per [`policies/briefs.md`](../../../policies/briefs.md): an `implemented` brief whose design has been superseded belongs at `historical`; a `draft` that has quietly become load-bearing needs promotion or a decision. Briefs decay if not maintained — this is the check behind that warning.
7. **Skills and agents.** Compare each `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` `last-reviewed:` date against the sweep date; re-read any skill past ~90 days or whose subject matter changed since its stamp. For agent definitions (no frontmatter date), use `git log -1 --format=%cs -- <file>` as the staleness heuristic. Flag steps that reference renamed files, retired tools, or contradicted policies.
8. **Lessons ledger.** Beyond the mechanical candidates list: apply the remedy-based scope test in `policies/lessons.md` when proposing methodology exports; preserve local lessons and existing owner rulings; flag `candidate` lessons that have sat unratified across multiple sweeps (propose graduate or reject — an undecided ledger is a silent backlog), and near-duplicate lessons that should merge (only when their *remedies* coincide — [`policies/lessons.md`](../../../policies/lessons.md) § Named families). **Read each occurrence `ref` against its own body**: a row that narrates several distinct instances is under-counting the lesson and silently suppressing the three-occurrence graduation trigger (the counting rule in `policies/lessons.md`) — this audit is the only enforcement that has ever caught it, because the lexical detectors built for it were all cut as hopeless. Treat catalog completeness and internal-link integrity as separate claims even though one deterministic checker now enforces both.
9. **Hub-only — methodology corpus.** Only when this repo is itself a template (detect: `.claude/skills/stamp/` exists). Audit the surfaces that propagate to every derived project: the universal policies, the methodology briefs, and the orchestration runtime doctrine in [`briefs/methodology.md`](../../../briefs/methodology.md) — applying the doctrine's own anti-ratchet rule: an instrument or rule whose defect class a design change eliminated is retired, not accumulated. A defect that ships from a template multiplies into every spoke; this audit exists because of that leverage.

10. **Pinned documents.** Read `docs/reference/README.md` against `docs/reference/` and the briefs and policies that cite each pin, per [`policies/docs.md`](../../../policies/docs.md). Flag: a pin nothing cites any more (retire it, catalog row and file together); a catalog row whose `As of` has fallen materially behind the source's current edition for a dependency the project still tracks (propose a re-pin, naming every citing brief and policy that must be re-read against the new text); a row with no recorded redistribution basis; and project-authored prose inside a pin, which belongs in a brief. Age alone is not staleness — weigh it against how fast the source moves.

Output of Stage 1 is internal. The user sees Stage 3's plan.

## Stage 2 — Classify and decide

### Three-way triage

Classify every finding into one of three tiers. The `AUTO` / `DECIDE` vocabulary is the one from [`policies/phase-ripple.md`](../../../policies/phase-ripple.md); `sweep` splits `DECIDE` in two because a maintenance pass surfaces far more judgment calls than a phase ripple does, and treating them all alike makes the pass either unusable or dangerous.

- **AUTO** — mechanical, with one correct shape (a dead link, a renamed path in a skill step, a catalog entry the checker flagged). Never discussed item by item; batched into the plan and applied on approval.
- **Batched DECIDE** — judgment-bearing but low-consequence and homogeneous. Presented as **one** grouped question with a numbered list and a single recommendation covering the group, answerable in a word ("all", "all but 3", "none").
- **Individual DECIDE** — settled one at a time, in the dialogue below.

### The line between the two DECIDE tiers

> **Does the item change what binds future work?** If it retires, weakens, creates, or re-scopes a rule, or changes a brief's authority status while something still cites it — it is decided individually. Otherwise it batches.

The test is checkable rather than a matter of feel, and it tracks the actual risk this skill carries: the silent loss of a binding rule.

**Individually decided:** retiring or demoting a policy; graduating a lesson into any rule surface; rejecting a lesson (which closes it permanently); merging two rules into one; deleting or demoting a binding orchestration step under the doctrine growth rule.

**Batched:** homogeneous status transitions nothing currently cites (five briefs moving `implemented` → `historical`); near-duplicate lesson merges whose remedies coincide and where neither is being graduated; aging ledger candidates proposed for the same disposition; catalog and wording drift the mechanical checkers already flagged.

When a batched group turns out to be heterogeneous once written down — the items need different recommendations, or one of them trips the line above — split it. A grouped question whose single recommendation doesn't actually cover every member is an individual queue wearing a batch's clothes.

### Plain language is the form of every individual DECIDE

An explanation must be readable by someone who has not opened the file being changed — the [`plain`](../../../.claude/skills/plain/SKILL.md) register, applied to a decision. State, in this order:

1. **What is true today**, as behavior — "today, every phase must X."
2. **What changes** — "nothing would require X any more."
3. **Why it came up** — contradicted by, superseded by, or has never fired since adoption.
4. **What breaks if the call is wrong.**
5. **The recommendation.**

Not acceptable as an explanation: naming a file path, quoting the rule's own text as though it were self-evident, or citing a frontmatter field. Paths and quotes appear as *evidence*, never as the explanation — this is [`policies/treatise.md`](../../../policies/treatise.md) § "Explain decisions, not files" applied to a conversation instead of a document.

### Decision dialogue

Work through the individual DECIDE items **one at a time**, with the batched groups taking one turn each:

1. Explain one decision in the plain-language form above.
2. Stop for the user's decision. Answer questions about that decision without advancing to the next one.
3. Advance only after the user gives an explicit decision.
4. If a rendered question appears to have been swallowed, interrupted, or answered ambiguously, re-present the entire decision — context, options, and recommendation — rather than referring to a missing question.
5. When a structured question control is used, the plain-language explanation goes in the message *preceding* it. Option labels are too short to carry it, and a short label is exactly how a consequential retirement gets waved through.

User-added requests during the dialogue join the same queue and are decided before the plan. If no judgment calls exist, skip directly to the plan. The dialogue remains read-only; an individual "yes" adopts that decision, not the write set.

## Stage 3 — Plan

Regenerate the **complete** plan from the resolved decisions. Do not offer an incremental patch or assume the user can reconstruct the plan from the dialogue. Every formerly-DECIDE item appears with its recorded decision, so the approval gate shows what was settled rather than re-asking it.

Use this shape:

```markdown
# Sweep: <repo-name> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Scope**: <full pass | focus: "<focus>">
**HEAD**: `<sha or "untracked">`

## Summary

<One paragraph: what the pass found, what it did not.>

## Mechanical checks

- `./bin/check-catalogs` — <pass | N findings>
- `./bin/lessons validate` — <pass | N findings>
- `./bin/lessons candidates` — <N graduation-ready>

## Settled decisions

- **<decision>** — decided: <the user's call>. <One line of consequence.>

## AUTO batch

- `<file>` — <the mechanical edit>

## Findings left open

- `<area>` — <what was found, why nothing is proposed this pass, whether a lesson was filed>

## Proposed write set

- `<file>` — NEW | MODIFY (diff size)

## Proposed LOG.md entry
```

The `SWEEP (<focus>)` entry is an authorized `LOG.md` entry kind — see the entry-kind table in [`policies/log-discipline.md`](../../../policies/log-discipline.md) § What `LOG.md` is. Write it; do not re-decide whether a sweep earns one.

An empty plan ("nothing stale") is a valid, reportable outcome.

## Stage 2 — Classify and plan

Classify every finding with the AUTO/DECIDE vocabulary from [`policies/phase-ripple.md`](../../../policies/phase-ripple.md):

- **AUTO** — mechanical with one correct shape (a dead link, a renamed path in a skill step, a catalog entry the checker flagged). Listed in the plan and applied on approval without item-by-item discussion.
- **DECIDE** — judgment-bearing (retire a policy, demote a brief, graduate or reject a lesson, merge near-duplicate rules). Each is presented with its evidence and a specific recommendation. When in doubt, DECIDE.

Present one plan: findings grouped by area, each tagged AUTO or DECIDE, with the exact proposed edit or disposition. An empty plan ("nothing stale") is a valid, reportable outcome.

## Stage 3 — Approve (gate)

Stop and wait for the user. The user may approve the whole plan, approve with exclusions, or reject. Graduating a lesson into a rule surface and retiring a policy are exactly the human-ratification acts [`policies/lessons.md`](../../../policies/lessons.md) and [`policies/human-in-the-loop.md`](../../../policies/human-in-the-loop.md) reserve for the user — `sweep` is the proposal mechanism, never the authority.

## Stage 4 — Apply

On approval:

1. Apply the approved edits (AUTO batch plus each ratified DECIDE).
2. For each graduated lesson: make the ratified edit to the target surface, then archive the lesson (`status: codified`, `closed:`, `graduated_to:`) into `lessons-archived/`. For each rejected lesson: archive with `status: rejected`. Run `./bin/lessons validate`.
3. Update `last-reviewed:` to today's date on every skill the sweep actually re-read — including ones with no findings.
4. Re-run the mechanical checks (`./bin/check-catalogs`, `./bin/lessons validate`) and finish with `./bin/check all`.
5. After the unchanged approved sweep passes `./bin/check all`, invoke
   `./bin/deliver --message <factual-message> -- <every explicit sweep path>`.
   Apply a current-session named `--no-push` or `--no-commit` restriction
   exactly. Park on any guard refusal. Then report findings by area, what was
   applied, declined, and remains open, plus delivery status.

## Rules

- **Read-only until the approval gate.** Stages 1–2 write nothing.
- **Retirement requires evidence.** "Old" is not a finding; contradicted, orphaned, superseded, or provably dead is. Cite the evidence in the plan.
- **Never weaken the evaluator.** The sweep may not propose loosening `./bin/check` gates, test coverage, or review independence to make a finding disappear — the improvement loop's evaluator stays isolated from the thing being improved.
- **One sweep, one report.** Findings deferred by the user stay findable: file or recur a lesson for anything the user wants remembered rather than re-discovered next sweep.
- **Cadence.** Run when the user invokes it; suggest it in a phase report only when a mechanical check is already failing or `./bin/lessons candidates` is non-empty. A reasonable default cadence is once per handful of completed phases, or before a `teach` pass exports surfaces to another repo.
- Cross-harness: this canonical skill drives both harnesses. Codex discovers it through the `.agents/skills/sweep` directory symlink and invokes it as `$sweep`.
